        <li>column names</li>
        <li>New columns added</li>
        <li>Converting the dataframe from wide to long format</li>
        <li>Merge files</li>
        <li>Change the data type of some columns</li>
        <li>Delete some columns that are not needed</li>
        <li>Droup missing values</li>
    </ul> 
</ul>
